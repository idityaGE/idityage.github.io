To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don\'t have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), navigate to the parent directory of the turborepo then enter the following command:\n\n```\nnpx turbo login\n```\n\nThis will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).\n\nNext, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:\n\n```\nnpx turbo link\n```\n\n## Authors ‚úçÔ∏è\n\n- [idityage](https://github.com/idityaGE)\n\n## Tech Stack üíª\n\n- **Languages:** TypeScript\n\n- **Frontend:** Next.js, TailwindCSS, React Hook Form, Zustand, React Flow, Shadcn/ui\n\n- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, bcryptjs\n\n- **Database:** PostgreSQL, Prisma\n\n- **Validation:** Zod\n\n- **Task Processing:** Kafka\n\n- **Authentication:** Cookie-based authentication with bcrypt for validation\n\n- **Email Service:** NodeMailer (for OTPs and other messages)\n\n- **Containerization:** Docker\n\n- **Container Orchestration:** Docker Compose\n\n- **Development Tools:** Turborepo, esbuild, Nodemon\n\n- **Deployment & Caching:** Vercel (with caching via Turborepo)\n\n';export{e as default};
